            <p> Hello, I am Xavier, a second year student at Pitt. My friends would describe me as nerdy, goofy, 
                and energetic. I'm a big fan of video games, and I enjoy watching movies. 
                I also like going to group exercise classes such as spin classes. I'm hoping to live on
                upper campus with an amazing friend!
            </p>
